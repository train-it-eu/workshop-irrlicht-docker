# [Modern C++ Design: Part I](https://train-it.eu/trainings/cpp/27-modern-cpp-design-part-1) Workshop Preparation

## Development Environment Setup

### Docker

The workshop is intended to run on a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container based on a provided image. The image
provides gcc, clang, CMake, Ninja, debuggers, clang-format, pre-configured [Conan package manager](https://conan.io),
and more...

To install [Docker](https://www.docker.com) please follow the point #1 of a detailed installation instruction in
[Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_installation) section of VSCode
documentation.

_Note:_ [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl) improves the performance of [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
on Windows. It is also a really powerful tool for daily C++ programming use. If you do not use it currently, please
consider installing it.

### XServer

[Irrlicht](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net) is an open source realtime 3D engine written in C++. In order to
see 3D graphics we will need to export docker container's display to the host's XServer.

#### Windows

1. Install [VcXsrv Windows X Server](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv).
2. Run `XLaunch` from the start menu and follow the configuration steps:
    - `Next` on "Display settings"
    - `Next` on "Client startup"
    - Check "Disable access control" on "Extra settings" and `Next`
    - `Finish` on "Finish configuration"
3. Uncomment appropriate line in "remoteEnv" part of `devcontainer.json` file.

#### Mac OS

1. Install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org) and use it in a similar way as in the above Windows case.
2. Uncomment appropriate line in "remoteEnv" part of `devcontainer.json` file.

#### Linux

1. Run the following command

```bash
xhost +SI:localuser:root
```

2. Uncomment appropriate line in "remoteEnv" part of `devcontainer.json` file.

### Visual Studio Code

The usage of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is strongly suggested for this workshop.
Make sure to enable at least the following extensions:
- [C/C++ Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack)

### Alternative Development Environments

You can try to use your own development environment for this workshop but in such a case please make sure that you:
- have a C++20-ready compiler,
- installed recent version of [CMake](https://cmake.org/download)
- installed [Conan package manager](https://conan.io) and provided a profile for your compiler
- [Windows only] [optional] installed [DirectX SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)
- can compile and run the [provided example](https://github.com/train-it-eu/irrlicht-example).


## Starting a docker container

1. When you open this folder in a VSCode it will ask:

    _Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file. Reopen folder to develop in a container (learn more)._

    - If on Windows and [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl) is not available:
      - choose `Clone in Volume`,
      - either provide a clone URL directly (https://github.com/train-it-eu/irrlicht-example.git) or choose
        "Clone a repository form GitHub in a Container Volume", and type "train-it-eu/irrlicht-example",
      - choose a volume for the repository (unique, current, other).
    - Otherwise, choose `Reopen in Container`.

2. Wait a moment for the container to initialize.
